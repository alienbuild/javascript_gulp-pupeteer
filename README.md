# Gulp / Pupeteer

This gulp script will systematically take screenshots of all .html files generated in your build, including modals that are triggered with a data-toggle attribute. Screenshots will be saved in a folder called '_jpegs' and then sorted into further sub folders for desktop and mobile screenshots.

Install dependencies or integrate this script into your current build.

`npm i` 

After installing dependencies run the following to begin the process.

`gulp shot`
